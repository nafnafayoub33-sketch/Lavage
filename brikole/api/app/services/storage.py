"""Where uploaded files go.

Two buckets, and the difference between them is the point:

- **public** holds avatars and portfolio photos. They are the shop window; a
  client loads a dozen at a time.
- **private** holds identity documents. Nobody but the owner and an admin ever
  reads one, and it is never served from a public path.

One bucket was the earlier temptation and does not survive contact with what
goes in it. A bucket is public or it is not.

`LocalDiskStorage` is what development uses. Production swaps in S3 or R2 by
implementing the same protocol, and no route changes.
